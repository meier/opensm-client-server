# This file contains the rules to allow or deny
# specific shell commands.
#
# NOTE: this uses the White/Black/File syntax
#       to create the rule set
#    -  if the White list is empty, all are accepted
#    -  if the Black list is empty, everything is rejected
#          unless it is contained in the White list
#    -  therefore if both are empty, all are accepted
#
* White (accept)
